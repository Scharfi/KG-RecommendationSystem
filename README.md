# KG-based Recommendation System

## Introduction

This repository contains the code of a recommendation system that uses an artificial neural network and a learning-to-rank approach to generate the recommendations. The recommendation system produces Top-N recommended products for a given product.
The recommendation system can be trained and tested on various embedding models that were produced from a Knowledge Graph.

The embedding model in this repository are generated using different embedding algorithm:
1.  Word2Vec
2.  RDF2Vec
3.  Pyke
4.  ConEx 
5.  HybridE (Combination of Word2Vec and ConEx)

### Generate the train and test data
To train and test the model, the data has to be generated by the class dataprocessor where you can specify the name of the embedding model
of choice (w2v, r2v, pyke, conex, hybride). To build centroid-based data, change centroid to "true" (not for HybridE).

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=dataprocessor -Dexec.args="conex false"
```
### Train the recommender

The training of the recommender is done in Class trainer for Word2Vec, RDF2Vec, Pyke, ConEx and in trainerHybridE Class for HybridE.
The model can be saved at any training phase (epoch), where it can be specified as args:
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=trainer -Dexec.args="conex 10 0.5 0.0000001 9000 no"
args1="Embedding model name" args2="Number of epochs" args3="LearningRate" args4="L2" args5="HiddenNodes" args6="Yes/No"(saveModel-optional)
```

The best performance configuration for each models:

| EmbeddingModelNames | #LearningRate | #L2 | #HiddenNodes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| w2v | 0.9 | 1e-7 | 9000 |
| r2v | 0.5 | 1e-7 | 9000 |
| pyke | 0.5 | 1e-7 | 9000 |
| conex | 0.5 | 1e-7 | 9000 |
| hybride | 0.9 | 1e-7 | 9000 |

The evaluation results are stored under data/evaluation/model_name.

### Other trainer
The class loader can load a model and further train and test it. 
The class Cheater generates centroid vectors for each product found in the test set and evaluates them.
